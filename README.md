# Biodiv-Visualization-Classifier
Biodiversity chart classifier that classifies chart from text


About our research
The biodiversity visualization classifier is our novice scientific research. In which, a classifier reads a biodiversity text and identifies the best fitting charts from a set of given different chart types. This classifier was incrementally trained on approx 50000 visualization/chart image and caption pairs available in the biodiversity literature. The classifier produces the result in the form of a ranked list of visualizations with the decreasing order of suitability to the data description. This work is a part of the project on visualization recommendations for biodiversity data. The goal of which is to suggest a suitable visualization for the exploration and presentation of the dataset.
